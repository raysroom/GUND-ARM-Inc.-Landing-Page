# Odin-Landing-Page
Landing Page project for foundations course of Odin Project

Created a Landing Page for the fictional company GUND-ARM Inc. from Mobile Suit Gundam: Witch From Mercury. I was more motivated to complete this project because of my excitement and interest in the show. What took longest was not the code, but actually the content within the page. I believe this project solidified my foundational understanding of flexbox, and I'm confident I can use it for future works.
